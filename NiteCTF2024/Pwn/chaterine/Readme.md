# My solution
The binary doesn't have the Canary protect, so will it be the buffer overflow attack?

Using `gdb`, I see the challenge is the `ret2win` challenge.

Using IDA, after a little bit reversing, I understand that the first input will allow us any value except `spiderdrive`, but to obtain the shell, we have to overwrite it somehow to win this.

Also, there're 2 format string vulnerabilities of 2 inputs, so we can abuse this to exploit.

Using the 2nd input, I see that in the 12th position (LOCAL), it has the stack address, using `gdb` to check the `$rbp` address.

Hmmmm, if the offset of these address doesn't change in different runtime, I will use this to get the address of the **1st input**.

And great, it doesn't change, using `Double Free` or `UAF` to make the chunk point to the stack which the **1st input** is locating, and finally change it with `spiderdrive` value and get the shell ;).

But nahhh, the program has the aligned tcache check, so I can't make the chunk to point to the stack LOL.

# Final solution
Asking in the Discord for help (Of course after the competition), I realize that they use modern version Libc. The version they are using is GLIBC-2.35 I think. Therefore, to solve this, I just get the address of the chunk I am using, the stack address using `%p` for 1st input, calculate them with `<stack_address> ^ <heap_chunk_address> >> 12`, we will use the final value to make the `chunk->next` point to the place we want.

Checking again with `gdb`, I see that now I am pointing to the 1st input of the program, now just get the shell and win the game.

The another factor that makes me feel complicated is that the offset of target server and my local is totally different due to the OS and GLIBC, so if I know the bypass tcache check I still couldn't solve this right ðŸ¤¡?
