# My solution
This challenge only has `NX` protection which we can't execute the shellcode in the stack.

During reconnaissancing and debugging the binary, I saw that after giving the input, the `$RAX` register will be equal to the `<size_of_input> + 1`.

The program also has few gadgets to make a simple ROP chain attack...

Nonetheless, the program has the `gift()` which provide us the `syscall` gadget, so with this I can do the Sigreturn ROP(SROP) technique to exploit, rightt? Great. Let's do this technique and make the program be executable so that we can use `ret2shellcode` to get the remote shell. Therefore, I will need the `mprotect()` value, the base address of the program, the size of program to reset the permission, the pointer of `main()` function because it has the `vuln()` function inside and the address of `syscall` gadget.

Great, so using `gdb`, I see that we are doing the right way, make the program run again to execute the `rt_sigreturn()` syscall, after that execute the `mprotect()` to make the binary executable.

SadlyðŸ¥¹, the program crashed but I didn't know why...

After searching I see that `SIGSYS` means that the program is using `seccomp()`, which means it will block some critical functions such as `syscall`, `execve`, `mprotect()`, etc.

Using IDA, I see the `prctl()` is calling the `seccomp()`.

# Final solution
Welp, there's a tool called `seccomp_tools` to check which function it will allow to execute in the binary, so after using it, I see that it allows `sendfile()`, which copy the content of a file descriptor to another file descriptor, such as STDOUT(fd=1)

The most important thing I've just learnt during the CTF is that I have to run `docker` so that I can do the local exploit as same as I am dealing with remote. So, to know the file descriptor of `flag.txt`, after running the docker, I just need to use this tool....

And we get the flag.
