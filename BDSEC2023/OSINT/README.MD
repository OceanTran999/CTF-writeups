This is an easy challenge for the beginner CTF like me. 
After reading the challenge, the words I focus on are: "Indian soldier", "DGFI", "RAB", "Indian external intelligence unit (RAW)", "arrested" and "Bangladesh"

First, I searched in Google and found the name of the soldier, and luckily it appeared first in Wikipedia.

Then I searched for the date that soldier was arrested.

Bingo!!! Then I had an answer for the flag
